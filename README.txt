== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have a Payger account? =

Yes. Before using the plugin you will need to register on [Payger](https://payger.com) as Business. This will
allow you to generate a Key and Secret pair that would than be needed to configure the plugin and start showing crypto currencies as a payment option.

= How will underpaid orders work? =

In case the payment is marked as underpaid, a new email with a new address is sent to the buyer so that he can complete the payment.
The order will still be On-hold until the payment isn't completed.

= Why is my order cancelled after 15 minutes without a payment? =

15 minutes is a Payger limit to finish a payment. Users will get a popup window after "Place Order" with a timer counter for 15 minutes.
On that popup there will be all the information to make the payment. The buyer must copy the address or scan the QrCode to process the payment.
If the buyer does not finish the payment within 15 minutes the order is cancelled. It's exactly the same behaviour as if you define 15 minutes as your hold stock time.
For that time the order will be "pending payment".

= What to do if the order expires? =

The buyer will need to select the products again and go to cart and checkout page.

= Is the stock restored if the order expires? =

Order gets cancelled but the stock is not restored. As WooCommerce does not restores stock on cancellation we also don't do it.
There are already some plugins to reduce stock upon cancellation.

The buyer will need to select the products again and go to cart and checkout page.
